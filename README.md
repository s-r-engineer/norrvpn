## Preface
The reason this software exist is that official NordVPN client sometimes consuming a shitload of CPU without any my request for doing anything whatsoever. I do not know what it is doing and who communicating with. I don't like it

The goal was to set everything from the commmand line to not to leave any text configs anywhere in the file system.

## NB!
* Right now **norrvpn** only available for Linux systems.
* No warranty whatsoever. You need to know what you are doing.
* Since there is a Diffie-Hellman implemented for secrecy large prime is used. And that large prime is unique for every
build. So you will not be able to use different versions for server and for client

## Dependencies
* ip (not sure if I really need it so probably will remove it)
* wg

## Usage
### Obtaining token from NordVPN
1. You do not need to get a new one if you already have one that you are ok to use.
2. Goto (https://my.nordaccount.com/dashboard/nordvpn/manual-configuration/)
3. Generate new token with the respected button.

### Installation
Either run `make install_x64` or copy binary to `/usr/local/bin` and `conf/norrvpn.service` into any place you like where
other services are (`/etc/systemd/system` I am using) and execute `systemctl daemon-reload` with sufficient privileges 

### init
1. Run `norrvpn init`
2. Enter PIN code twice
3. Enter token [from before](#obtaining-token-from-nordvpn)
4. Token will be encrypted and saved in $HOME/.config/norrvpn/token.json

### UP
Run `norrvpn up [country code]`

Country code is almost the same one will be using with standard nordvpn cli client.
The issue here is that they have aliases for some countries. For example in their system United Kingdom has code
**gb** but from the cli it is also available as **uk**. If not sure - grep from the [countries](#list-countries) output

### DOWN
Run `norrvpn down`

### LIST COUNTRIES
Run `norrvpn listCountries`
